# Fluid (WIP)
Yet another (work in progress) [Lattice-Boltzmann fluid simulation](https://marl0ny.github.io/wasm-fluid2d/), implemented using C++ with OpenGL and GLFW compiled to WebAssembly. The primary reference is Daniel Schroeder's [instructional document](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/LatticeBoltzmann.pdf) for his javascript+HTML5 [Fluid Dynamics Simulation](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids/), on which this project is based on.

The [opengl-canvas-wasm](https://github.com/timhutton/opengl-canvas-wasm) example by [timhutton](https://github.com/timhutton/opengl-canvas-wasm) was particularly helpful in learning how to get a WebAssembly program to run.
