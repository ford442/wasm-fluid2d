# Fluid (WIP)
Yet another Lattice-Boltzmann fluid simulation, implemented using C++ with OpenGL and GLFW compiled to WebAssembly. The primary reference is Daniel Schroeder's [instructional document](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/LatticeBoltzmann.pdf) for his javascript+HTML5 [Fluid Dynamics Simulation](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids/), on which this project is based on.
